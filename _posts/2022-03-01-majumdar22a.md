title: Detecting Bias in the Presence of Spatial Autocorrelation
abstract: In spite of considerable practical importance, current algorithmic fairness
  literature lacks technical methods to account for underlying geographic dependency
  while evaluating or mitigating bias issues for spatial data. We initiate the study
  of bias in spatial applications in this paper, taking the first step towards formalizing
  this line of quantitative methods. Bias in spatial data applications often gets
  confounded by underlying spatial autocorrelation. We propose hypothesis testing
  methodology to detect the presence and strength of this effect, then account for
  it by using a spatial filtering-based approachâ€”in order to enable application of
  existing bias detection metrics. We evaluate our proposed methodology through numerical
  experiments on real and synthetic datasets, demonstrating that in the presence of
  several types of confounding effects due to the underlying spatial structure our
  testing methods perform well in maintaining low type-II errors and nominal type-I
  errors.
