title: Fair Clustering Using Antidote Data
abstract: Clustering algorithms are widely utilized for many modern data science applications.
  This motivates the need to make outputs of clustering algorithms fair. Traditionally,
  new fair algorithmic variants to clustering algorithms are developed for specific
  notions of fairness. However, depending on the application context, different definitions
  of fairness might need to be employed. As a result, new algorithms and analysis
  need to be proposed for each combination of clustering algorithm and fairness definition.
  Additionally, each new algorithm would need to be reimplemented for deployment in
  a real-world system. Hence, we propose an alternate approach to group-level fairness
  in center-based clustering inspired by research on data poisoning attacks. We seek
  to augment the original dataset with a small number of data points, called antidote
  data. When clustering is undertaken on this new dataset, the output is fair, for
  the chosen clustering algorithm and fairness definition. We formulate this as a
  general bi-level optimization problem which can accommodate any center-based clustering
  algorithms and fairness notions. We then categorize approaches for solving this
  bi-level optimization for two different problem settings. Extensive experiments
  on different clustering algorithms and fairness notions show that our algorithms
  can achieve desired levels of fairness on many real-world datasets with a very small
  percentage of antidote data added. We also find that our algorithms achieve lower
  fairness costs and competitive clustering performance compared to other state-of-the-art
  fair clustering algorithms.
