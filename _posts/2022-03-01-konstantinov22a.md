title: On the Impossibility of Fairness-Aware Learning from Corrupted Data
abstract: Addressing fairness concerns about machine learning models is a crucial
  step towards their long-term adoption in real-world automated systems. Many approaches
  for training fair models from data have been developed and an implicit assumption
  about such algorithms is that they are able to recover a fair model, despite potential
  historical biases in the data. In this work we show a number of impossibility results
  that indicate that there is no learning algorithm that can recover a fair model
  when a proportion of the dataset is subject to arbitrary manipulations. Specifically,
  we prove that there are situations in which an adversary can force any learner to
  return a biased classifier, with or without degrading accuracy, and that the strength
  of this bias increases for learning problems with underrepresented protected groups
  in the data. Our results emphasize on the importance of studying further data corruption
  models of various strength and of establishing stricter data collection practices
  for fairness-aware learning.
